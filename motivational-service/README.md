# Motivational Microservice 🌟

## Overview 🚀

The **Motivational Microservice** is a lightweight backend service designed to provide **random motivational phrases** to users. It aims to inspire and encourage users by delivering positive and uplifting messages. This microservice is a part of the **UserService** domain, where it enhances the user experience by providing dynamic and personalized interactions.

### Purpose 💡
This service fetches random motivational phrases stored in a simple **phrase repository** and delivers them to the frontend application whenever requested. It is ideal for applications where user engagement and morale are critical, such as social networks, productivity apps, or fitness platforms.

## Architecture & Design Pattern 🏗️

### Microservice Architecture 🔥
- **Microservices Architecture**: This service is built as a **self-contained unit** that can be deployed independently of other services. It communicates with the main application through **RESTful APIs** to deliver the motivational phrases.

### Design Pattern 🎯
- **Controller-Service Pattern**: The application follows the **controller-service design pattern**. The controller manages HTTP requests and responses, while the service contains the business logic for generating and retrieving the motivational phrases.

- **Simple Layered Architecture**: The application is divided into layers, each responsible for a single aspect of the application. These layers are **Controllers**, **Services**, and **Data**.

### Key Components 💎
1. **Controllers**: Handle incoming requests and map them to the corresponding service logic. They interact with the **PhraseService** to generate and deliver motivational phrases.
2. **Services**: Contain the business logic for retrieving and sending random phrases. The **PhraseService** is the core service responsible for fetching a random phrase.
3. **Data**: Contains the data layer, in this case, **`phrases.php`**, which holds an array of predefined phrases. 

## Features 🌟

- **Random Phrase Generation**: The microservice provides random motivational phrases that are fetched from a local database.
- **Easy Integration**: The service can be easily integrated with any frontend application via a simple REST API.
- **Scalability**: Deployed as a Docker container, it allows for easy scaling and deployment across multiple environments.
- **CORS Enabled**: Ensures cross-origin requests can be made from frontend applications.

## Folder Structure 📁

- **controllers**: Contains the **`phraseController.php`** file, which handles HTTP requests and responses related to motivational phrases.
- **data**: Contains **`phrases.php`**, which stores the list of predefined motivational phrases.
- **services**: Contains **`phraseService.php`**, where the main business logic for generating and retrieving the random phrases resides.
- **.htaccess**: Configures the server to handle URL rewriting, ensuring clean URLs for the API endpoints.
- **Dockerfile**: Defines the environment for the containerized application, specifying the PHP environment and dependencies required for the service to run.
- **index.php**: The entry point of the service, where requests are routed to the appropriate controllers and services.

## How to Deploy 🛠️

This microservice is containerized using **Docker**, allowing it to be easily deployed and scaled on various cloud platforms or servers.

### Steps to Deploy:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.dev/Loony213/UserService
    cd UserService
    ```

2. **Build the Docker Image**:
    ```bash
    docker build -t kamartinez/motivational .
    ```

3. **Run the Docker Container**:
    ```bash
    docker run -d --name motivational-service -p 80:80 --restart unless-stopped kamartinez/motivational
    ```

    This will run the microservice on port 80, making it accessible through your host machine.

4. **Access the Service**:
    After running the container, the service will be available at **http://localhost/get-phrase** (or your server IP if deployed remotely).

## Technologies Used ⚙️

- **PHP** for backend development.
- **Docker** for containerization and deployment.
- **CORS** for cross-origin resource sharing, allowing the service to be accessed from different origins.
- **Apache** with **.htaccess** for server configuration and URL rewriting.

## Future Enhancements 🚀

- 🌍 Expand the set of motivational phrases with daily or personalized themes.
- 🔄 Implement a more sophisticated database for managing and storing a wider variety of phrases.
- 🌐 Add multilingual support to cater to users from different regions.
- 💬 Integrate with AI services to provide personalized motivational messages based on user activity or mood.

## Conclusion ✨
