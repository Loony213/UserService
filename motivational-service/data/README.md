# Data Folder 📂

## Overview 🌟

The **data** folder contains the **`phrases.php`** file, which serves as the repository for all motivational phrases. This file holds an array of predefined phrases that are randomly selected and sent to the user through the **motivational-service**.

### Role of the **phrases.php** File 📜

- **Phrase Repository**: The **`phrases.php`** file is a simple PHP array that stores a list of motivational phrases. These phrases are used to inspire and encourage users.
- **Static Data**: The data is static in nature, providing a set of predefined motivational phrases that are returned whenever a request is made.
- **Random Selection**: The phrases are randomly selected from the array by the **PhraseService**, which is responsible for returning a random phrase whenever requested by the **PhraseController**.

### Why This Folder Is Important 📝

- **Centralized Data**: The **data** folder centralizes all the static data (motivational phrases) in one place. This helps keep the code organized and makes it easier to update or add new phrases in the future.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Keeping the phrases in a separate file from the rest of the application ensures that the business logic (service) and the data are decoupled, improving the maintainability of the application.
- **Extensibility**: As the application grows, additional files and data can be added to the **data** folder, enabling future features like supporting multiple categories of phrases or even pulling data from an external source.
